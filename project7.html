  <h2>A place I would like to visit.</h2>
  <p class="place-description"> I would like to visit London England because from movies I have seen the people there seem angry and I think I would fit right in. Also, it rains there a lot so I would like that also.</p>

  <h2>A person I admire</h2>
  
  <p class="person-description"> Someone I admire very much probably would be Mike Tyson. First of all, he's survived the world with that terrible lisp he has. But he also <span class="important-point">became the youngest Lineal Heavyweight champion</span> in the boxing world while being the smallest guy in the division.</p>
